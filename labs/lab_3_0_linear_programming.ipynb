    "# **Maximizing Profit in a Car Parts Manufacturing Workshop**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you run a small workshop that makes two types of car parts: **Car Part A** (engine brackets) and **Car Part B** (gear housing covers). Each part requires materials and time to produce, but your resources are limited. Your goal is to figure out how many of each car part you should produce to earn the most profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called **optimization**. It's about making the best decisions while staying within your limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Your Products and Profits**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Car Part A (Engine Brackets)**:\n",
    "  - Profit: **\\$30** per unit sold.\n",
    "- **Car Part B (Gear Housing Covers)**:\n",
    "  - Profit: **\\$40** per unit sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Your Resource Limits**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two main resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Metal Sheets**:\n",
    "   - Used to make both parts.\n",
    "   - Total available: **8 sheets per day**.\n",
    "   - **Engine Brackets** use **1 sheet** per unit.\n",
    "   - **Gear Housing Covers** use **2 sheets** per unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Machine Hours**:\n",
    "   - Total available: **9 hours per day**.\n",
    "   - **Engine Brackets** take **3 hours** to make one unit.\n",

    "- **Constraints**: The limits we need to respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by defining our objective mathematically. As we established, the total profit from our workshop is the number of **Engine Brackets** times the profit per bracket plus the number of **Gear Housing Covers** times the profit per cover. This can be written as:\n",
