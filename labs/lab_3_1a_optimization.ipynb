    "\n",
    "Imagine a Canadian company that needs to transport goods from its distribution centers to retail stores across the country. Each distribution center has a limited supply, and each store requires a certain amount of goods. Additionally, transporting goods incurs costs, which depend on the route between the distribution center and the store. Our goal is to determine the optimal transportation plan to minimize total costs.\n",
