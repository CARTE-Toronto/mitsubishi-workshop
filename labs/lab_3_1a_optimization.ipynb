    "Imagine a company that needs to transport goods from warehouses to stores. Each warehouse has a limited supply, and each store requires a certain amount of goods. Additionally, transporting goods incurs costs, which depend on the warehouse-store route. Our goal is to determine the optimal transportation plan to minimize total costs.\n",
