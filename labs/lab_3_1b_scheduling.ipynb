    "This notebook will guide you through solving an employee scheduling problem using Google OR-Tools. We will schedule employees for a workweek, ensuring each employee works within their required minimum and maximum hours, while also meeting a minimum staffing level for each shift.\n",

    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a company that needs to schedule employees for a workweek. Each employee has specific constraints:\n",
    "- **Minimum shifts**: The least number of shifts they must work during the week.\n",
    "- **Maximum shifts**: The most number of shifts they can work during the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the company requires a minimum number of employees to be working during each shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine the optimal schedule that meets all these constraints."
