    "This lab will be using notebooks as a Python development environment. Notebooks are a great way to interactively develop code and are widely used in the data science community. They allow us to mix together code, text, and images in a single document.\n",

    "Let's get started by running some Python code. When we work with Python, we almost always rely on _libraries_ - collections of code that provide functionality beyond what is available in the core Python language. In this lab, we're going to be using two libraries: NumPy and scikit-learn.\n",
